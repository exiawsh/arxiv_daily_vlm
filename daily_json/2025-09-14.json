        "title": "Maestro: Self-Improving Text-to-Image Generation via Agent Orchestration",
        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models, while offering immense creative potential, are\nhighly reliant on human intervention, posing significant usability challenges\nthat often necessitate manual, iterative prompt engineering over often\nunderspecified prompts. This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving\nimage generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve\ngenerated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial\nprompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where\nspecialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify\nweaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide\ninterpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent\nwhile preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge\nfor head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing\nproblematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with\nuser intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models\ndemonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial\nprompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with\nmore advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and\neffective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.",
